I've a number of little personal projects you can't see, and one or two that are public.
My code is in various states of proto-type up to a more enterprise approach.
I care deeply about how best to solve problems, and code readability is a passion of mine.
At the same time I've been seasoned by many years of trial and error, as well as reading excellect books, mostly for commercial interest.
There's little in my collection that says I have interest in writing games with C#.
